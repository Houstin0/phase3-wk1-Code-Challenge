# phase3-wk1-Code-Challenge
This repository contains solutions to three problems for the code challenge.
## Challenges
### Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
This function converts 12-hour time to 24-hour time.
when given an hour, a minute and a period (either "am" or "pm") as inputs, the function returns a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.
#### solution and setup
The solution can be found in the "converting_time.py" file
To use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone <repository_link>.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
4. Modify or change the input values in the solution files as needed.
5. Run the solutions using a Python interpreter using "python3 converting_time.py"

### Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive.
This function when provided inputs of three integers as arguments, it returns True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers, and False - otherwise.
#### solution and setup
The solution can be found in the "two_numbers_are_positive.py" file
To use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone <repository_link>.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
4. Modify or change the input values in the solution files as needed.
5. Run the solutions using a Python interpreter using "python3 two_numbers_are_positive.py"

### Challenge 3: Consonant value.
This function given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, it returns the highest value of consonant substrings.
#### solution and setup
The solution can be found in the "consonant_value.py" file
To use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone <repository_link>.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
4. Modify or change the input values in the solution files as needed.
5. Run the solutions using a Python interpreter using "python3 consonant_value.py"
